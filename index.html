      <h5>Question 1: How does JavaScript work?</h5>
      <p>Answer: JavaScript is a single-threaded, high-level, interpreted language, not a compiled language. Programing language such as C, C#, C++, Java etc. needs to be compiled first then it's run. Compiler translates the source code into bytecode which the machine can understands and execute it. On the other hand JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead an interpreter in the browser reads all the JavaScript code, interprets every line and then runs it. These days, modern browser use a technology known as Just In Time (JIT) compilation which compiles JavaScript code to executable bytecode just as it's about to run. JavaScript is also a client side scripting language which means it runs at the client side or on the client machine inside the browser, but the most important thing to remember that client's browser also needs to support the JavaScript or it must be enabled the JavaScript. Modern browsers support JavaScript and have their own JavaScript engines. For example, Google Chrome JavaScript engine name is V8. We already know that JavaScript is an interpreted language that's why the JavaScript engine converts the JavaScript code line by line then runs it in the same manner instead of converting the whole program once.</p>
      <h5>Question 2: What does JavaScript event loop do?</h5>
      <p>Answer: The mystery behind JavaScript's asynchronous programming is event loop. JavaScript executes all the operation on a single thread but using some smart data structure it gives us the taste of multi threading. Let's take a look on the back end and see what happened. The call stack is liable for monitoring every one of the tasks in line to be executed. When a function is finished it's popped from the call stack. The event queue sends new function to the call stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure to manage the right sequence in which function should be sent for execution. The event loop manage this process, it continuously checks whether the call stack is blank or not. If it's blank new functions are added from the event queue, if not then current function call is processed.</p>
      <h5>Question 3: What are the differences between local storage and session storage?</h5>

          <tr>
            <td>Local storage is not session-based, it can be deleted via JavaScript or manually</td>
            <td>Session storage is a session-based and works per window or tab, this means the data is stored only for the duration of a session</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Local storage's data has no expiration date</td>

            <td>Local storage's data shared between all tabs and windows from the same origin</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Local storage's data remains after the browser restart and even operating system (OS) reboot</td>
